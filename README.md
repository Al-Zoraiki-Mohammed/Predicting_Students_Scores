Through this simple project, we aim to provide a practical demonstration of fundamental machine learning concepts and their application to real-world data. This beginner-friendly project aims to employ supervised machine learning to predict students' scores based on study hours, recognizing the crucial connection between study time and academic performance. The primary objective is to develop a simple linear regression model, involving only two variables: study hours (input data $x$) and actual scores (the target data $y$). This simple project is focused on practice and learning. To achieve this goal, we are utilizing a small dataset containing information about study hours and scores for specific students. Our approach involves a step-by-step process, with a particular emphasis on elaborating on the important details.
